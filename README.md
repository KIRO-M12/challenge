### Inspiration and Framework Adaptation

This project incorporates ideas and methods adapted from resources like [website name or URL], customized to fit a multi-framework stack. Styles and attributes were optimized across frameworks, including:

- **Laravel/Vue.js**: Style handling was tailored to Vue components, ensuring compatibility with SCSS and JavaScript.
- **React/Next.js (with TypeScript)**: Inline style transformations were refined for JSX, especially converting camelCase to kebab-case for CSS properties, making the project fully compatible with TypeScript in Next.js.
- **jQuery**: Adjustments were made for legacy JavaScript and jQuery compatibility, allowing consistent inline style handling.

> **Note**: Each frameworkâ€™s styling is adapted to improve functionality and maintain consistency throughout the project, inspired by the principles on [website name].
